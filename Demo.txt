Sure, here are the basic commands for pushing code to a Git repository:

First, navigate to your local Git repository using the command line interface or terminal.

Add all your changes to the staging area using the git add command. For example, git add . adds all changes to the staging area.

Commit your changes with a descriptive message using the git commit command. For example, git commit -m "added new feature to app"

Next, add the remote repository URL to your local Git repository using the git remote add command. For example, git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git

Check the remote repository URL using the git remote -v command. This command will list all remote repositories you have added to your local Git repository.

Push your changes to the remote repository using the git push command. For example, git push origin master pushes the changes to the "master" branch of the "origin" remote repository.

These are the basic Git commands to push your code to a Git repository. However, the specific commands may vary depending on your workflow, branching strategy, and repository setup.
